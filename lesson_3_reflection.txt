When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can identify 3 main reasons:
    - A backup of your local work;
    - Allow you to work in different locations and diferent computers;
    - Allow team projects in an easier way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    As the remote can be used for very different purposes, it makes little sense to have automatic sync between local and remote repository. An automatic sync could cause a wide range of problems in situations like team projects, etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of someone else's repository, that creates a copy of that same repository in your profile. A clone is a copy of a remote to our local environment. A branch is just a sequence of commits in a repository. 
    A fork could be used to work on top of someone project, without messing with the original project itself. A clone could be used to work in colaboration. A branch can be used within a project to allow for certain features development paralel to the core code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That copy works as a point in origin of the project, if you have to work offline for example. Later you can sync with the remote starting from that last known state.

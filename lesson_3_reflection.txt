When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can identify 3 main reasons:
    - A backup of your local work;
    - Allow you to work in different locations and diferent computers;
    - Allow team projects in an easier way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    As the remote can be used for very different purposes, it makes little sense to have automatic sync between local and remote repository. An automatic sync could cause a wide range of problems in situations like team projects, etc.
